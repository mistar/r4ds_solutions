# r4ds_solutions
In this repository you can find my solutions of exercises given in the book  “R for Data Science”, by Hadley Wickham and Garrett Grolemund. The free and most recent version of the book can be found on http://r4ds.had.co.nz/.  I have created solutions based on the first edition of the book from December 2016.

The book does not provide solutions to the exercises, so I have created this repository with my own solutions that are of course susceptible to mistakes. If you notice any mistakes, please do give me feedback. Enjoy!
Please notice: This is still work in progress, but as soon as I get next chapter sorted I will commit it to github.
